# neuromix

this python package has the purpose to serve as a tool for the design and analysis of general neural networks, both artificial and spiking.

The modules are:
- <brain>: computational substrates, i.e. networks and nodes
- <sim>: training and testing environments, i.e. classes to evaluate the substrate performance
- <tools>: function and classes to futher analyize and visualize network structures and dynamics
