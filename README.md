this python package has the purpose to serve as a tool for the design and analysis of general neural networks, both artificial and spiking.

The modules are:
- **brain**: computational substrates, *i.e. networks and nodes*
- **sim**: training and testing environments, *i.e. classes to evaluate the substrate performance*
- **tools**: function and classes to futher analyize and visualize network structures and dynamics, *e.g. draw the network graph*
